# Using Finite State Machines in UI Development

## What is a State Machine?

A mathematical model of computation that describes the behavior of a system that
can be in only one state at any given time.

---

### The Five Parts of a State Machine

1. A finite number of **states**
2. A finite number of **events**
3. An **initial state**
4. A **transition function** that determines the next state given the current
   state and event
5. A (possibly empty) set of **final states**

---

## Finite Number of States

ex. idle, loading, failure, success

---

## Finite Number of Events

ex. fetch data, resolve, reject, retry

---

## Initial State

ex. idle, waiting for user input

---

## Transition Function

Typically handled by the state machine to determine what state we're in after an
event happens.

---

## Final States

Not always present. The component could just go back to the idle state on
resolution ready to be used again.
